# movie_trailers

The movie_trailers repo creates a static html website to show movie trailers using python scripts.

```media.py``` defines the class movie.

```entertainment_center.py``` initializes the six movies to be shown in the website, and executes the function 

```python
fresh_tomatoes.open_movies_page(movies)
```

to load the website.

```fresh_tomatoes.py``` contains the website html and functions that extract data from entertainment_center.py.
